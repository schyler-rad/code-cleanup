# CodeCleanup Week 1 Reflections

## Introduction
- This R code is the oldest script in my files, originally written as an "attendance quiz" for my introductory psychometrics class.
- Last updated: **September 16, 2016**.
- Purpose of this week's cleanup: improve readability, efficiency, and maintainability of the code.

## Goals and Plan
1. **Code Documentation**
   - Upload or copy/paste the original code into the repository.
   - Use branching to preserve the original code while working on updates in a separate branch.

2. **Improvements**
   - Enhance readability by refactoring unclear logic and adding comments.
   - Improve efficiency by identifying bottlenecks or redundancies and optimizing them.
   
3. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Quantitative: Test whether the updated code executes faster than the original version.
   - Qualitative: Provide a detailed explanation of why the updated code is easier to maintain.

4. **Deliverables**
   - Upload of the original code with annotations.
   - A comparison of the original and updated code (e.g., through side-by-side comments or a diff tool).
   - New test scripts demonstrating the improved performance.
   - A write-up explaining how and why the updated code is more maintainable.

## Reflection
- **Challenges:** Document difficulties encountered while cleaning up and optimizing the code (e.g., unfamiliar syntax, logical errors).
- **Lessons Learned:** Summarize insights gained about writing cleaner and more efficient R code.
- **Next Steps:** Identify how these learnings can inform future code cleanup projects.
